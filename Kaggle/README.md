# Kaggle

A list of Kaggle Competitions I have participated in.

* HousePrices: an EDA into housing prices in Ames, Iowa, based on many more features than the standard Boston Housing Prices dataset. I explored R's ggplot2 library through this competition.
* Kobe: given a list of all Kobe's shot in his career in the NBA, predict the probability of his shot making it and minimize for log-loss.
* NN: created a CNN in Tensorflow to correctly label handwritten digits in the MNIST dataset.
* Titanic: used R and feature engineering to predict Titanic passenger survival.
