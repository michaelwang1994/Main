%% ==================== Part 1: Email Preprocessing ====================
%  To use an SVM to classify emails into Spam v.s. Non-Spam, you first need
%  to convert each email into a vector of features. In this part, you will
%  implement the preprocessing steps for each email. You should
%  complete the code in processEmail.m to produce a word indices vector
%  for a given email.

fprintf('\nPreprocessing sample email (emailSample1.txt)\n');

% Extract Features
file_contents = readFile('emailSample1.txt');
word_indices  = processEmail(file_contents)
